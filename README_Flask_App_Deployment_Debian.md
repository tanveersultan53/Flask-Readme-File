# Deploying a Flask Application on Debian Linux

## Introduction
Deploying a Flask application on a Debian server involves setting up the server environment, installing necessary software, and configuring the server to run the application. This guide will walk you through the process step by step.

## Prerequisites
- A Debian Linux server (Debian 10 or 11)
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands
- Flask application ready for deployment

## Steps

### 1. System Update
Before starting, update your system to ensure all packages are current:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### 2. Installing Python and pip
Flask is a Python framework, so your server needs Python and pip:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

### 3. Virtual Environment Setup
Using a virtual environment for your Flask project is good practice. It isolates your project's Python environment from the system.
- Install virtualenv:
  ```bash
  sudo pip3 install virtualenv
  ```
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/my_flask_app
  cd ~/my_flask_app
  virtualenv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Flask Installation
With your virtual environment active, install Flask:
```bash
pip install Flask
```

### 5. Flask Application Deployment
Place your Flask application within the ~/my_flask_app directory.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 6. Local Flask Application Testing
Test your Flask app locally to ensure it's working:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=your_app.py  # Replace with your app's main file
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

### 7. Gunicorn Installation and Configuration
Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP server for your Flask app.
- Install Gunicorn:
  ```bash
  pip install gunicorn
  ```
- Run your app with Gunicorn:
  ```bash
  gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 your_app:app
  ```

### 8. Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup
Setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy is recommended for public applications.
- Install Nginx:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nginx
  ```
Add the following configuration to this file. Replace myapp, example.com, and 5000 with your application's name, your domain name, and the port where Gunicorn is listening, respectively.

  
- Configure Nginx:
  Create and link a new Nginx configuration file, and set up Nginx to forward requests to Gunicorn.
  - Step 1: Create a New Nginx Configuration File
      Create a new configuration file for your Flask application in Nginx's sites-available directory. You can name         this file after your domain or application, like myapp.


    ```
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp
    ```

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
# Create a symbolic link of the file in the sites-enabled directory:

``` sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled ```

# check the syntax of file
``` sudo nginx -t ```
# restart our ngnix service

``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ```

``` sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' ```


- Restart Nginx:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

### 9. Process Management with systemd
Use systemd to ensure your Flask app runs continuously.
- Create a systemd service file in /etc/systemd/system/.
- Enable and start your service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start yourapp
  sudo systemctl enable yourapp
  ```

### 10. Firewall Configuration
Make sure your firewall allows traffic on the necessary ports (80 and 443).

### 11. SSL Setup
For internet-facing applications, set up SSL with Let's Encrypt and Certbot.

## Conclusion
Following these steps, you can successfully deploy a Flask application on a Debian server. Ensure you test each component thoroughly and secure your application, especially if it's accessible over the internet.
